AI Anime Character Generator
Anime characters have captivated audiences worldwide with their unique and imaginative designs. With the power of artificial intelligence (AI), we can now generate high-quality, detailed anime-style characters with just a few prompts.

In this project, we demonstrate how to create an AI anime character generator using Next.js (a popular React framework for server-side rendering) and Replicate (a platform that provides access to pre-trained AI models). Combining these technologies allows us to generate unique anime characters based on user input.

Features:
Generate anime characters: Users can provide text prompts to generate custom anime characters.
Server-side rendering: Built with Next.js for fast and optimized performance.
AI-powered generation: Uses Replicate's AI model to create high-quality, detailed anime-style characters from textual descriptions.

How It Works:
Authentication with Replicate API: The app integrates with Replicate to use a pre-trained AI model.
Character Generation: Users enter prompts to generate anime characters. The system sends the prompts to Replicate, which returns the generated character images.
Next.js Integration: The backend and front end are built with Next.js to handle server-side rendering and dynamic content generation.
